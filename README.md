## Project Objectives

## What I've learnt with this project / Challenges I faced 

## Notes / Room for improvement 

I do have some planning when I start my projects. I think like it helps me with not knowing how to start which is usually a problem for us.
So I usually do something like this:
-Create the app boilerplate 
-Create the notes.md file that you mention and jot down the following:
     -App functionalities(this is usually the ones that TOP requirements mention)
     -General idea of the hierarchy of components and which methods/state will every component have
     -How will these Components communicate between each other
     -Later I do create a TODO section where I will proceduraly create a todo check-list to know what to do next
-Then I try to get a general idea of how the UI will look, I use this webpage to create the view.png file that you mentioned: https://excalidraw.com/
With that you can download your drawing and include it in your project, so you have the project UI structure at all times right there.
-Then I start creating my Components in code and start filling out the functions and state that will populate that component. This is very basic and general, I just define the functions but I do not include any code within them, instead I do what's mentioned on the next step.
-When I'm done with defining the functions, I grab every single one and start pseudocoding the logic that will follow within the function body
function doCoolStuff(coolPar){
  //Declare cool variable
  //Declare cool array
  //Push cool variable within cool array
  //If cool array length is bigger than 32390232
     //Return from this function
  //Else
     //Yell at the user for not being cool
}

And from here on, it usually all comes down automatically ðŸ˜„
